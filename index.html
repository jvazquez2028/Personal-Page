    <p id= "about-me-para">Hello! My name is Jackie, I am an aspiring engineer out of the Dallas area. I have a background in education, and am excited to grow in the field of web development. I am part of the G{Code} house cohort, which connects women of color to opportinities in the technology sector. Join me on my journey to become a web developer! </p>
    
    <section id="about">   
        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p> I was born in a beautiful port city in Michoacan, Mexico called Lazaro Cardenaz. I moved to Phoenix, Arizona with my family when I was 5 years old. If you love tacos and hiking, I highly recomend a visit. I am DACAmented, which means my educational journey had many ups and downs, but I had the privilage of graduating college with the support of my family and friends. </p>

        <h4> Career</h4>
        <p> I joined Teach For America after college, and moved to the Dallas-Fort Worth area to start my teaching career. I've been in the classroom teaching 5th graders for a few years. This has been a challenging and rewarding experiance, but I am ready for a new challenge where I can continue to grow. I am currently learning web develpment through G{Code} and #100Devs, and am excited, confused, and tired all at the same time, but it definately worth it! I've learned so much in just a couple of weeks. I can't wait to see where I'll be in a year!
        </p>

        <h4>Hobbies</h4>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include dancing, cooking, being a plant mom, and I recently discovered karaoke which now I love, try it if you haven't yet. I also love spending my time watching New Girl, its hard finding a new show when that one is amazing! I'm also a bit of a Mexican food connoisseur, so if you have any recomendations in the Dallas area, send them my way! So happy to meet you! Let's continue on this coding journey.  </p>
